## GW 7

Thinking about no transfers this week.

## GW 8
Won't panic and transfer in Palmer. If all goes to plan I should have 3 transfers for GW 8. Might see how Semenyo does and reassess who is the priority. I really don't trust Trent and Diaz v Chelsea but if I had to keep one I trust Diaz to get a return more than Trent in defense. 

I think I might get Johnson and Maddison for Semenyo and Luis Diaz.

Need to get out:

 1. Trent
 2. Semenyo
 3. Diaz
 4. Jackson

Potential transfers:
- Watkins
- Havertz
- Solanke
- Delap
- Ndaiye
- Maddison
- Brennan Johnson
- Eze
- Foden: start risk
- Trossard: rotation risk, iffy fixtures
- Martinelli: rotation risk, iffy fixtures
- Romero
- Konsa
- Van De Ven
- Timber
- Saliba: first thought is too expensive
- Calafiori: rotation risk

## GW 9
If it goes to plan all I should need to do this GW is aim for Saka > Palmer
